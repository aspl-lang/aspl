ASPL is a modern programming language featuring beautiful simplicity, seamless cross-platform support, practical OOP and so much more.

## Why ASPL?
* <b>Simple ðŸ˜€</b>
<br>The syntax is clean and readable, error messages provide useful information, and installing ASPL is as easy as a few clicks.

* <b>Safe ðŸ”’</b>
<br>High-level abstractions, automatic memory management, out-of-the-box TLS support, and a strong type system make ASPL one of the safest languages out there.

* <b>Cross platform ðŸ’»</b>
<br>Newcomers as well as experienced programmers can easily create powerful cross-platform applications with ASPL; seamless cross-compilation is one of ASPL's core design principles.

* <b>Huge standard library ðŸ”¥</b>
<br>Built-in JSON, graphics, and advanced networking support are just a few of the things that will drastically speed up your coding process.

* <b>Modular architecture ðŸ“š</b>
<br>ASPL has a great and simple modular library system that helps you reuse any kind of third-party code in your projects, including even the ASPL compiler itself.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> ASPL is still in early development and some features are missing or incomplete. Even though the language is already quite stable and very practical, it is not yet recommended for production use. Contributions are always welcome!

# Code Examples
-> means the program prints text to the console
<br><- means the user types something into the console
## Hello World
```aspl
print("Hello World!") // print means "write into the console"
```
**Output:**
<br>-> Hello World!

## Favorite food
```aspl
var favoriteFood = input("What's your favorite food?") // prints "What's your favorite food" and waits until the user types something into the console
if(favoriteFood == "Spaghetti"){ // checks whether the users input matches a certain string, here: "Spaghetti"; if it doesn't, the code between the braces will be skipped
    print("Hm, yummy, that's my favorite food too!")
}else{ // the following code is executed only if the condition in the if statement evaluated to false, here: the input was not "Spaghetti"
    print("Sounds great!")
}
```
**Example Output:**
<br>-> What's your favorite food?
<br><- Spaghetti
<br>-> Hm, yummy, that's my favorite food too!

## Random number
```aspl
import rand

print(rand.irange(1, 100)) // prints a random number between 1 and 100 to the console
```
**Example Output:**
<br>-> 42
